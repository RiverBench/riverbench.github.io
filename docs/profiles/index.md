# Profiles

Profiles in RiverBench group datasets that share common technical characteristics. For example, the profile [stream-triples-rdfstar](stream-triples-rdfstar/dev) includes only datasets that are triple streams using RDF-star. The profiles are intented to be used in benchmarks to compare the performance of different systems on a well-defined collection of datasets.

You can find the list of all profiles in the menu on the left.
