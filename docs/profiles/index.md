# Profiles

Profiles in RiverBench group datasets that share common technical characteristics. For example, the profile [stream-triples-rdfstar](stream-triples-rdfstar/dev) includes only datasets that are triple streams using RDF-star. The profiles are intented to be used in benchmarks to compare the performance of different systems on a well-defined collection of datasets.

You can find the list of all profiles in the menu on the left.

!!! tip

    Profiles have machine-readable metadata in RDF. You can find RDF download links for each profile on its documentation page. You can also use the HTTP content negotation mechanism.

    On the bottom of each profile's page you will also find a handy table with download links for all datasets in the profile.
