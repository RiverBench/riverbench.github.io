# Profiles

Profiles in RiverBench group datasets that share common technical characteristics. For example, the profile [stream-triples-rdfstar](stream-triples-rdfstar/dev.md) includes only datasets that are triple streams using RDF-star. The profiles are intented to be used in benchmarks to compare the performance of different systems on a well-defined collection of datasets.

!!! tip

    Profiles have machine-readable metadata in RDF. You can find RDF download links for each profile on its documentation page. You can also use the [HTTP content negotation mechanism](../documentation/metadata.md).

    On the bottom of each profile's page you will also find a handy table with download links for all datasets in the profile.
