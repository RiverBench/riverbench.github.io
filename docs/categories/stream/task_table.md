[Grouped RDF stream compression](https://w3id.org/riverbench/v/dev/tasks/stream-compression) | [`stream-compression`](https://w3id.org/riverbench/v/dev/tasks/stream-compression) | A benchmark task measuring the compression efficiency of serializations for grouped RDF streams. 
[Grouped streaming deserialization throughput](https://w3id.org/riverbench/v/dev/tasks/stream-deserialization-throughput) | [`stream-deserialization-throughput`](https://w3id.org/riverbench/v/dev/tasks/stream-deserialization-throughput) | A benchmark task measuring the throughput of deserializing a grouped RDF stream (that is, a stream in which the elements are either RDF graphs or RDF datasets) from a byte stream to memory. 
[End-to-end streaming latency](https://w3id.org/riverbench/v/dev/tasks/stream-latency-end-to-end) | [`stream-latency-end-to-end`](https://w3id.org/riverbench/v/dev/tasks/stream-latency-end-to-end) | A benchmark task measuring the latency of streaming elements in a grouped RDF stream over the network, including serialization, network communication, and deserialization.
