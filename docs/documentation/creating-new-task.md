# Creating a new benchmark task

This guide explains how to propose a new benchmark task to be included in RiverBench.

## Step 0: What is a benchmark task?

A benchmark task is a description of a concrete benchmarking procedure, for example: measuring deserialization throughput. Each task can be associated with several metrics, for example average throughput, 95th percentile throughput, and memory usage.

Each task belongs to one [benchmark category](categories.md). A benchmark category is a group of tasks that share the same requirements for datasets. For example, the `stream` category contains tasks that require a [grouped RDF stream](https://w3id.org/stax/dev/taxonomy/#grouped-rdf-stream) as input. Have a look at the [list of benchmark categories](https://w3id.org/riverbench/category) to see the existing categories.

## Step 1: Create a task proposal

1. Open a new task proposal in the RiverBench repository: **[click HERE](https://github.com/RiverBench/RiverBench/issues/new?assignees=Ostrzyciel&labels=new+task&projects=&template=task-proposal.md&title=Task+proposal%3A+%5BIDENTIFIER+HERE%5D)**.
2. Fill in the form with the required information (see below).
    - **Short description of the task:** Provide a brief and informative description of the task (what is being measured, how, and why). You can later expand on this description when the task is created.
    - **Task usefulness (why is the task important):** Explain the significance of the task. For example, the task may measure a performance aspect that is not covered by other tasks, or it may be useful for comparing different systems.
    - **Past benchmarking efforts and task descriptions (if any):** Provide links to any past benchmarking efforts or task descriptions that are related to the proposed task (for example, a paper describing the task).
    - **Proposed identifier:** Suggest a unique identifier for the task using only lowercase latin letters, digits, and dashes (-).
    - **Does the task need a new benchmark category?** Answer "yes" if there is no suitable benchmark category for the task. If you answer yes, please explain what kind of category is needed.
    - **[Existing benchmark category](https://w3id.org/riverbench/category), if applicable:** If the task requires a new category, leave this field blank. Otherwise, provide the identifier of the existing category that the task should be added to.
    - **Proponent(s):** List the names of the task's proponents.
    - **License statement:** Answer "YES" to agree to the description and metadata of this task being published under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license **(required)**.

!!! note

    If you have trouble filling in any of the fields, you can leave them blank and ask the maintainer for help.

## Step 2: Wait for approval

An administrator will be notified your request and will review the form and the task description. The administrator may ask for additional information or clarifications.

## Step 3: Create a pull request

Once the task proposal is approved, you will be able to create a pull request to add the task to the category repository. The pull request should:

- Create a new subfolder under the `tasks` folder of the category repository. The name of the folder must match the task's identifier.
- Create a `metadata.ttl` file using [this template](https://github.com/RiverBench/category-template/blob/main/tasks/metadata.ttl) to the task's folder.
- Fill out the metadata in the `metadata.ttl` file using the information from the task proposal.
  - The description of the task in `dcterms:description` should be only enough to understand what the task is about. The details about metrics, specific procedures, etc., should be included in the task's documentation (see below).
  - Example of a completed `metadata.ttl` file: [stream-latency-end-to-end](https://github.com/RiverBench/category-stream/blob/main/tasks/stream-latency-end-to-end/metadata.ttl).
- Create a `index.md` file that will contain the task's elaborated description. Example: [stream-latency-end-to-end](https://github.com/RiverBench/category-stream/blob/main/tasks/stream-latency-end-to-end/index.md).
- (optional) Create any number of additional documentation pages for the task, for example, a page with the task's results. You can also include images in the task's folder.

## Step 4: Wait for merge

The admin will review your pull request (if they don't â€“ remind them in the your task proposal with a comment). Once the pull request is approved, the task will be added to the category repository and will be available on the RiverBench website. :tada:
