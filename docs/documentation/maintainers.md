# RiverBench maintainers

**RiverBench is a community-owned project**, maintained and curated by volunteers.

## Curators

**Curators** are people experienced with RDF benchmarks who review proposals for [new datasets](creating-new-dataset.md) and [benchmark tasks](creating-new-task.md). They also have the deciding voice in other proposals and discussions about RiverBench (e.g., changes to the suite's structure or the addition of new features).

Curators do not have any strict obligations to RiverBench – all work is done on a purely voluntary basis.

New curators may be appointed with a consensus of the existing curators. If you are interested in becoming a curator, please contact any of them.
