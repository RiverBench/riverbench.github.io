# How to contribute?

**Hi there!** :wave: :blush:

RiverBench is an open, [community-driven](maintainers.md) project, so you are more than welcome to contribute. This page explains how to do it.

## Chat with the community

If you have any questions or want to discuss your ideas, feel free to join our **[Discord chat](https://discord.gg/HYkutTWsJ9)**.

## Reporting benchmark results

If you have run a benchmark using RiverBench's datasets or tasks, **we highly encourage you to [share your results](reporting-results.md)**. After filling out a simple form, your benchmark run will be [listed on the RiverBench website](../results/index.md) (along with proper citation, of course) in a machine- and human-readable format. See our dedicated brief guide on **[reporting benchmark results](reporting-results.md)** for more details.

## Contributing datasets

Do you have an interesting RDF dataset that would make a good addition to RiverBench? Great!

Have a look at the **[dedicated guide on creating new datasets](creating-new-dataset.md)** which also explains the requirements for new datasets. If you still have questions, don't hesitate to contact RiverBench's maintainers by [opening an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/RiverBench/RiverBench/issues/new/choose).

## Contributing benchmark tasks

Do you want to share your benchmarking procedure with the world? Publishing it in RiverBench will give your task a permanent URI and make it easy to reference in papers and other publications. Others will also have the chance to contribute their results and notes about conducting the benchmark.

## Reporting issues

Found a bug in a dataset or the metadata? Or in something else entirely? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/RiverBench/RiverBench/issues/new/choose). Please try to be as specific as possible on your issue, so that it can be resolved quickly.

## Improving the documentation

You can easily edit the documentation on this website – see the [dedicated guide](editing-docs.md) for more details.
