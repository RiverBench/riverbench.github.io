# Dataset: yago-annotated-facts (development version)

This is a subset of the [YAGO 4 knowledge base](https://yago-knowledge.org/downloads/yago-4) ([paper](https://suchanek.name/work/publications/eswc-2020-yago.pdf)), based on Wikidata, [version from February 24, 2020](https://yago-knowledge.org/data/yago4/full/2020-02-24/). This dataset includes only the fact annotations in RDF-star, that is facts about facts. Each stream element corresponds to one item in Wikidata.

## Distributions


### Download links

The dataset is published in a few size variants, each containing a specific number of stream elements.
For each size, there are three distribution types available: flat
(an N-Triples/N-Quads file in the [RDF Message Log format](https://w3c-cg.github.io/rsp/spec/messages)),
streaming (a .tar.gz archive with Turtle/TriG files, one file per stream element),
and [Jelly](https://w3id.org/jelly) (a native binary format for streaming RDF).
See the [documentation](../../documentation/dataset-release-format.md) for more details.
