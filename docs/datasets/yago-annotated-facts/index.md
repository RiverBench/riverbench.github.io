# yago-annotated-facts (development version)

This is a subset of the [YAGO 4 knowledge base](https://yago-knowledge.org/downloads/yago-4) ([paper](https://suchanek.name/work/publications/eswc-2020-yago.pdf)), based on Wikidata, [version from February 24, 2020](https://yago-knowledge.org/data/yago4/full/2020-02-24/). This dataset includes only the fact annotations in RDF-star, that is facts about facts. Each stream element corresponds to one item in Wikidata.

The stax:usedIn property is recommended to indicate where the stream is used – alternatively you can use its inverse (stax:hasStreamTypeUsage). The use of other properties (e.g., rdfs:label, rdfs:comment) is encouraged to give more context about the usage.
