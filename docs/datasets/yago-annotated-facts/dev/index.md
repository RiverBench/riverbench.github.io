# yago-annotated-facts (development version)

This is a subset of the [YAGO 4 knowledge base](https://yago-knowledge.org/downloads/yago-4) ([paper](https://suchanek.name/work/publications/eswc-2020-yago.pdf)), based on Wikidata, [version from February 24, 2020](https://yago-knowledge.org/data/yago4/full/2020-02-24/). This dataset includes only the fact annotations in RDF-star, that is facts about facts. Each stream element corresponds to one item in Wikidata.

- **<abbr title="Inverse of stax:isUsageOf – indicates that the subject is related to a usage of an RDF stream type.

        - **Type**: <abbr title="Class for instances of using an RDF stream type, in a program, an academic paper, or elsewhere. This class is suitable for annotating both theoretical uses and practical ones, i.e., real streams or datasets.  Instances of this class should have the stax:hasStreamType property pointing to a concrete stream type. The stax:usedIn property is recommended to indicate where the stream is used – alternatively you can use its inverse (stax:hasStreamTypeUsage). The use of other properties (e.g., rdfs:label, rdfs:comment) is encouraged to give more context about the usage.  Note that 'stream type usage' is a subjective assertion and instances of this class may be annotated with additional provenance properties to explain who made the assertion.

Instances of this class should have the stax:hasStreamType property pointing to a concrete stream type. The stax:usedIn property is recommended to indicate where the stream is used – alternatively you can use its inverse (stax:hasStreamTypeUsage). The use of other properties (e.g., rdfs:label, rdfs:comment) is encouraged to give more context about the usage.  Note that 'stream type usage' is a subjective assertion and instances of this class may be annotated with additional provenance properties to explain who made the assertion.
