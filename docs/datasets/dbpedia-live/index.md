# Dataset: dbpedia-live (development version)

[DBpedia Live](https://www.dbpedia.org/resources/live/) was a real-time service that monitored edits on Wikipedia and published a stream of changes to the DBpedia knowledge graph. This dataset contains only the "added" triples in the stream, so it does not include deletes or other types of changes. Only one month (January 2014) is covered at the moment, but the dataset can be easily expanded in the future (the service stopped functioning in 2021). The stream's elements are irregular in size, depending on the volume of traffic on Wikipedia at a given moment and how the DBpedia Live service was able to cope with it. See also the [paper](http://jens-lehmann.org/files/2012/program_el_dbpedia_live.pdf).
    
The dataset was extensively cleaned to fix or remove bad IRIs, bad Unicode, and invalid literals.

## Distributions


### Download links

The dataset is published in a few size variants, each containing a specific number of stream elements.
For each size, there are three distribution types available: flat (just an N-Triples/N-Quads file),
streaming (a .tar.gz archive with Turtle/TriG files, one file per stream element),
and [Jelly](https://w3id.org/jelly) (a native binary format for streaming RDF).
See the [documentation](../../documentation/dataset-release-format.md) for more details.
