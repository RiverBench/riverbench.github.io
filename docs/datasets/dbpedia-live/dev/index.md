# dbpedia-live (development version)

[DBpedia Live](https://www.dbpedia.org/resources/live/) was a real-time service that monitored edits on Wikipedia and published a stream of changes to the DBpedia knowledge graph. This dataset contains only the "added" triples in the stream, so it does not include deletes or other types of changes. Only one month (January 2014) is covered at the moment, but the dataset can be easily expanded in the future (the service stopped functioning in 2021). The stream's elements are irregular in size, depending on the volume of traffic on Wikipedia at a given moment and how the DBpedia Live service was able to cope with it. See also the [paper](http://jens-lehmann.org/files/2012/program_el_dbpedia_live.pdf).
    
The dataset was extensively cleaned to fix or remove bad IRIs, bad Unicode, and invalid literals.

## Technical metadata

- **<abbr title="Inverse of stax:isUsageOf – indicates that the subject is related to a usage of an RDF stream type.

    - **RDF stream type usage (1)**    
        - **Type**: <abbr title="Class for instances of using an RDF stream type, in a program, an academic paper, or elsewhere. This class is suitable for annotating both theoretical uses and practical ones, i.e., real streams or datasets.  Instances of this class should have the stax:hasStreamType property pointing to a concrete stream type. The stax:usedIn property is recommended to indicate where the stream is used – alternatively you can use its inverse (stax:hasStreamTypeUsage). The use of other properties (e.g., rdfs:label, rdfs:comment) is encouraged to give more context about the usage.  Note that 'stream type usage' is a subjective assertion and instances of this class may be annotated with additional provenance properties to explain who made the assertion.
