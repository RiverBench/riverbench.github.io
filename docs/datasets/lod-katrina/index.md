# Dataset: lod-katrina (development version)

The Katrina dataset from the Linked Observation Data collection by the Kno.e.sis Center describes weather measurements from many weather stations across the US during the Katrina hurricane. See more details on [LOD Cloud](http://cas.lod-cloud.net/dataset/knoesis-linked-sensor-data) and the [original website (Internet Archive)](https://web.archive.org/web/20200111135659/http://wiki.knoesis.org:80/index.php/LinkedSensorData).

## Distributions


### Download links

The dataset is published in a few size variants, each containing a specific number of stream elements.
For each size, there are three distribution types available: flat (just an N-Triples/N-Quads file),
streaming (a .tar.gz archive with Turtle/TriG files, one file per stream element),
and [Jelly](https://w3id.org/jelly) (a native binary format for streaming RDF).
See the [documentation](../../documentation/dataset-release-format.md) for more details.

This class is suitable for annotating both theoretical uses and practical ones, i.e., real streams or datasets.  Instances of this class should have the stax:hasStreamType property pointing to a concrete stream type. The stax:usedIn property is recommended to indicate where the stream is used – alternatively you can use its inverse (stax:hasStreamTypeUsage). The use of other properties (e.g., rdfs:label, rdfs:comment) is encouraged to give more context about the usage.  Note that 'stream type usage' is a subjective assertion and instances of this class may be annotated with additional provenance properties to explain who made the assertion.
