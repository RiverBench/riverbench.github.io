# lod-katrina (development version)

The Katrina dataset from the Linked Observation Data collection by the Kno.e.sis Center describes weather measurements from many weather stations across the US during the Katrina hurricane. See more details on [LOD Cloud](http://cas.lod-cloud.net/dataset/knoesis-linked-sensor-data) and the [original website (Internet Archive)](https://web.archive.org/web/20200111135659/http://wiki.knoesis.org:80/index.php/LinkedSensorData).

The stax:usedIn property is recommended to indicate where the stream is used – alternatively you can use its inverse (stax:hasStreamTypeUsage). The use of other properties (e.g., rdfs:label, rdfs:comment) is encouraged to give more context about the usage.
