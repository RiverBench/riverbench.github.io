# digital-agenda-indicators (development version)

The dataset of [EU Digital Agenda Key Indicators](https://digital-agenda-data.eu/datasets/digital_agenda_scoreboard_key_indicators) contains statistical information about the European information society. The dataset is composed of a series of statistical observations with various properties and a very regular structure.

This is a large, typical dataset with statistical information, with a very regular structure. In contrast to [linked-spending](https://w3id.org/riverbench/datasets/linked-spending/dev), this dataset does not include textual information and is more homogenous, making it an interesting comparison point for aggressive compression algorithms.

This class is suitable for annotating both theoretical uses and practical ones, i.e., real streams or datasets.

The stax:usedIn property is recommended to indicate where the stream is used – alternatively you can use its inverse (stax:hasStreamTypeUsage). The use of other properties (e.g., rdfs:label, rdfs:comment) is encouraged to give more context about the usage.
