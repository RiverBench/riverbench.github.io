# Dataset: digital-agenda-indicators (1.0.3)

The dataset of [EU Digital Agenda Key Indicators](https://digital-agenda-data.eu/datasets/digital_agenda_scoreboard_key_indicators) contains statistical information about the European information society. The dataset is composed of a series of statistical observations with various properties and a very regular structure.

This is a large, typical dataset with statistical information, with a very regular structure. In contrast to [linked-spending](https://w3id.org/riverbench/datasets/linked-spending/dev), this dataset does not include textual information and is more homogenous, making it an interesting comparison point for aggressive compression algorithms.

## Distributions


### Download links

The dataset is published in a few size variants, each containing a specific number of stream elements.
For each size, there are three distribution types available: flat (just an N-Triples/N-Quads file),
streaming (a .tar.gz archive with Turtle/TriG files, one file per stream element),
and [Jelly](https://w3id.org/jelly) (a native binary format for streaming RDF).
See the [documentation](../../documentation/dataset-release-format.md) for more details.
