# muziekweb (development version)

The dataset consists of the main graph of [Muziekweb](https://data.muziekweb.nl/), a high-quality Dutch knowledge base about music, containing information about artists, CD, LPs, and more. The knowledge base is richly annotated and contains plentiful links to external resources.

    - **Type**: <abbr title="Class for instances of using an RDF stream type, in a program, an academic paper, or elsewhere. This class is suitable for annotating both theoretical uses and practical ones, i.e., real streams or datasets.  Instances of this class should have the stax:hasStreamType property pointing to a concrete stream type. The stax:usedIn property is recommended to indicate where the stream is used – alternatively you can use its inverse (stax:hasStreamTypeUsage). The use of other properties (e.g., rdfs:label, rdfs:comment) is encouraged to give more context about the usage.  Note that 'stream type usage' is a subjective assertion and instances of this class may be annotated with additional provenance properties to explain who made the assertion.
