# Dataset: muziekweb (development version)

The dataset consists of the main graph of [Muziekweb](https://data.muziekweb.nl/), a high-quality Dutch knowledge base about music, containing information about artists, CD, LPs, and more. The knowledge base is richly annotated and contains plentiful links to external resources.

## Distributions


### Download links

The dataset is published in a few size variants, each containing a specific number of stream elements.
For each size, there are three distribution types available: flat (just an N-Triples/N-Quads file),
streaming (a .tar.gz archive with Turtle/TriG files, one file per stream element),
and [Jelly](https://w3id.org/jelly) (a native binary format for streaming RDF).
See the [documentation](../../documentation/dataset-release-format.md) for more details.
