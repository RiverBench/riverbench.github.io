# Dataset: politiquices (development version)

Support and opposition relations extracted from news articles archived in Arquivo.pt. The dataset describes news articles in Portuguese and the presented political stances. [Dataset source](https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/6130e331078190fd0c6c3819?locale=en), [more information about the project (Portuguese)](https://www.politiquices.pt/about).

## Distributions


### Download links

The dataset is published in a few size variants, each containing a specific number of stream elements.
For each size, there are three distribution types available: flat (just an N-Triples/N-Quads file),
streaming (a .tar.gz archive with Turtle/TriG files, one file per stream element),
and [Jelly](https://w3id.org/jelly) (a native binary format for streaming RDF).
See the [documentation](../../documentation/dataset-release-format.md) for more details.
