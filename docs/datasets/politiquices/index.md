# Dataset: politiquices (development version)

Support and opposition relations extracted from news articles archived in Arquivo.pt. The dataset describes news articles in Portuguese and the presented political stances. [Dataset source](https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/6130e331078190fd0c6c3819?locale=en), [more information about the project (Portuguese)](https://www.politiquices.pt/about).
    
**Changed in 1.1.0**: Previous versions of the dataset contained literals with ASCII control codes (0x07, BEL). Although these are allowed in RDF, they are non-serializable in RDF/XML 1.1. To maintain better compatibility, all 21 instances of this character were replaced with whitespace (0x20, SP). The modified dataset has the exact same byte length in N-Triples/Turtle when uncompressed and the modification should not affect any benchmarks in a significant way. More details in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/RiverBench/dataset-politiquices/issues/1).

## Distributions


### Download links

The dataset is published in a few size variants, each containing a specific number of stream elements.
For each size, there are three distribution types available: flat (just an N-Triples/N-Quads file),
streaming (a .tar.gz archive with Turtle/TriG files, one file per stream element),
and [Jelly](https://w3id.org/jelly) (a native binary format for streaming RDF).
See the [documentation](../../documentation/dataset-release-format.md) for more details.
