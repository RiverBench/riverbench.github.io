# Dataset: assist-iot-weather (1.0.3)

This is a timestamped stream of weather data collected with a Davis Vantage Pro 2 weather station installed on the building of the [Systems Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences](https://www.ibspan.waw.pl/en/home/). The data was collected during the [ASSIST-IoT Horizon 2020 project](https://assist-iot.eu/). The station measured several different weather parameters and transmitted them in real time at regular intervals. The measurements have rich annotations with the [SOSA/SSN](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-ssn/) and [OM 2.0](http://www.ontology-of-units-of-measure.org/page/om-2) ontologies. The stream is very regular and the elements only differ by numeric values and timestamps.
    
The dataset is a real application of RDF streaming (originally streamed over MQTT), with much richer annotations than [citypulse-traffic](https://w3id.org/riverbench/datasets/citypulse-traffic). On the other hand, it is perfectly regular, with no differences in structure between stream elements.

## Distributions


### Download links

The dataset is published in a few size variants, each containing a specific number of stream elements.
For each size, there are three distribution types available: flat (just an N-Triples/N-Quads file),
streaming (a .tar.gz archive with Turtle/TriG files, one file per stream element),
and [Jelly](https://w3id.org/jelly) (a native binary format for streaming RDF).
See the [documentation](../../documentation/dataset-release-format.md) for more details.
