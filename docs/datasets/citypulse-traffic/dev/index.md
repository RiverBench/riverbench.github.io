# citypulse-traffic (development version)

This is a processed subset of real traffic data published by the [CityPulse EU FP7 project](http://iot.ee.surrey.ac.uk:8080/index.html). The used dataset is '[Road Traffic Data](http://iot.ee.surrey.ac.uk:8080/datasets.html#traffic)', dataset-4. The dataset was processed to fix prefixes without a trailing '#' or '/'. The dataset consists of subsequent chronologically ordered substreams of observations from each sensor. See also [the paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/300337751_CityBench_A_Configurable_Benchmark_to_Evaluate_RSP_Engines_Using_Smart_City_Datasets) for more details.
