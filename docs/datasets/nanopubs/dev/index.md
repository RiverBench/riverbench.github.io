# nanopubs (development version)

Nanopublications are small units of publishable information, used for scientific results and more. This dataset is based on a subset of [a dump of all available nanopublications](https://zenodo.org/record/1213293) as of April 5, 2018. Only the first 5M of freely-licensed nanopubs were included. Each nanopub consists of several RDF graphs and thus is an RDF dataset. The included data is primarily from the biomedical domain. More information: [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06532), [website](https://nanopub.net/).
