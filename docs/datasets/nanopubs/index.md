# Dataset: nanopubs (development version)

Nanopublications are small units of publishable information, used for scientific results and more. This dataset is based on a subset of [a dump of all available nanopublications](https://zenodo.org/record/1213293) as of April 5, 2018. Only the first 5M of freely-licensed nanopubs were included. Each nanopub consists of several RDF graphs and thus is an RDF dataset. The included data is primarily from the biomedical domain. More information: [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.06532), [website](https://nanopub.net/).

## Distributions


### Download links

The dataset is published in a few size variants, each containing a specific number of stream elements.
For each size, there are three distribution types available: flat (just an N-Triples/N-Quads file),
streaming (a .tar.gz archive with Turtle/TriG files, one file per stream element),
and [Jelly](https://w3id.org/jelly) (a native binary format for streaming RDF).
See the [documentation](../../documentation/dataset-release-format.md) for more details.

    - **Type**: <abbr title="Class for instances of using an RDF stream type, in a program, an academic paper, or elsewhere. This class is suitable for annotating both theoretical uses and practical ones, i.e., real streams or datasets.  Instances of this class should have the stax:hasStreamType property pointing to a concrete stream type. The stax:usedIn property is recommended to indicate where the stream is used – alternatively you can use its inverse (stax:hasStreamTypeUsage). The use of other properties (e.g., rdfs:label, rdfs:comment) is encouraged to give more context about the usage.  Note that 'stream type usage' is a subjective assertion and instances of this class may be annotated with additional provenance properties to explain who made the assertion.
