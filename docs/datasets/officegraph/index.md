# Dataset: politiquices (development version)

[OfficeGraph](https://github.com/RoderickvanderWeerdt/OfficeGraph/tree/main) is a real-world data of measurements from 444 IoT devices taken over 11 months. The devices are made up of 17 different sensor models which measure different properties. Data was taken in Dutch 7-story office building and consists of about 90 million RDF triples. See also the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-60635-9_6) for more details.

The elements in the dataset are ordered from oldest to newest by the measurement time (saref:hasTimestamp predicate).

Additional data such as data about devices taking measurements and rooms in the building as well as copy of this dataset can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14690081).

## Distributions


### Download links

The dataset is published in a few size variants, each containing a specific number of stream elements.
For each size, there are three distribution types available: flat (just an N-Triples/N-Quads file),
streaming (a .tar.gz archive with Turtle/TriG files, one file per stream element),
and [Jelly](https://w3id.org/jelly) (a native binary format for streaming RDF).
See the [documentation](../../documentation/dataset-release-format.md) for more details.
