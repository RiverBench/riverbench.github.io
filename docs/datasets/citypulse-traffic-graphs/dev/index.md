# citypulse-traffic-graphs (development version)

This is a variation of the [citypulse-traffic](https://w3id.org/riverbench/datasets/citypulse-traffic) dataset that was transformed into a stream of graphs, compliant with the [RSP Data Model](https://streamreasoning.org/RSP-QL/Abstract%20Syntax%20and%20Semantics%20Document/). The dataset is a processed subset of real traffic data published by the [CityPulse EU FP7 project](http://iot.ee.surrey.ac.uk:8080/index.html). The used dataset is '[Road Traffic Data](http://iot.ee.surrey.ac.uk:8080/datasets.html#traffic)', dataset-4. The dataset was processed to fix prefixes without a trailing '#' or '/'. It consists of subsequent chronologically ordered substreams of observations from each sensor. See also [the paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/300337751_CityBench_A_Configurable_Benchmark_to_Evaluate_RSP_Engines_Using_Smart_City_Datasets) for more details.

This class is suitable for annotating both theoretical uses and practical ones, i.e., real streams or datasets.

The stax:usedIn property is recommended to indicate where the stream is used – alternatively you can use its inverse (stax:hasStreamTypeUsage). The use of other properties (e.g., rdfs:label, rdfs:comment) is encouraged to give more context about the usage.  Note that 'stream type usage' is a subjective assertion and instances of this class may be annotated with additional provenance properties to explain who made the assertion.
