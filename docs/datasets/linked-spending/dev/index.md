# linked-spending (development version)

This is a subset of the LinkedSpending dataset (LS package 2013-9), which contains government spending information from around the world. The dataset uses the [RDF Data Cube vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/). Only the spending observations were kept in this subset, extra contextual information was discarded. See the [website](http://linkedspending.aksw.org/) and the [paper](https://www.semantic-web-journal.net/system/files/swj923.pdf) for more details.
