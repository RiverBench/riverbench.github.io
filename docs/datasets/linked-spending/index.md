# Dataset: linked-spending (development version)

This is a subset of the LinkedSpending dataset (LS package 2013-9), which contains government spending information from around the world. The dataset uses the [RDF Data Cube vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/). Only the spending observations were kept in this subset, extra contextual information was discarded. See the [website](http://linkedspending.aksw.org/) and the [paper](https://www.semantic-web-journal.net/system/files/swj923.pdf) for more details.

## Distributions


### Download links

The dataset is published in a few size variants, each containing a specific number of stream elements.
For each size, there are three distribution types available: flat (just an N-Triples/N-Quads file),
streaming (a .tar.gz archive with Turtle/TriG files, one file per stream element),
and [Jelly](https://w3id.org/jelly) (a native binary format for streaming RDF).
See the [documentation](../../documentation/dataset-release-format.md) for more details.
